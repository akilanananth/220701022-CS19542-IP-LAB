Rajalakshmi Engineering College (REC) is a premier institution committed to excellence in engineering education, research, and innovation. Our focus on advancing technology is exemplified by our active involvement in cutting-edge projects and our dedication to fostering a culture of innovation. This commitment is highlighted by our successful organization of an IEEE International Conference in the past, which brought together scholars, industry experts, and students from around the world. Building on this momentum, we are planning multiple events to engage our students actively. Our vibrant IEEE Student Chapter, with societies spanning various departments, plays a pivotal role in fostering innovation and collaboration across disciplines.
